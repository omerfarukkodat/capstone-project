# **Center of Pressure (COP) Feature Extraction Tool**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the development and implementation of a Center of Pressure (COP) feature extraction tool, created through a collaborative effort between software engineers and biomedical engineers. The tool is designed to analyze and visualize COP data obtained from measurements related to human balance and stability.

## **Features**

- **MATLAB Data Processing:** Utilizes advanced signal processing techniques and algorithms in MATLAB to process and analyze COP data.
  
- **Python Interface with TKinter:** A user-friendly interface developed in Python using TKinter, allowing users to interact with COP data, visualize measurements, and explore extracted features.

- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts various features such as sway amplitude, velocity, and area, providing valuable insights into human balance.

- **Seamless Integration:** MATLAB-generated plots seamlessly integrated into the Python interface, enhancing the understanding of COP data patterns and characteristics.

- **Customization Options:** Offers customization options for visualizations, allowing users to tailor the interface according to specific requirements.

- **Data Export Functionality:** Supports data export functionality, enabling researchers and clinicians to incorporate COP data into their workflows.
